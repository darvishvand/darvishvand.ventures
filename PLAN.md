# Darvishvand.Ventures Launch Plan

## Introduction

This document outlines the comprehensive, step-by-step plan to launch and operationalize Darvishvand.Ventures, a Decentralized Autonomous Startup Accelerator. The plan is derived from the foundational research paper "Darvishvand.Ventures: A Decentralized Autonomous Organization Framework for Startup Acceleration." It translates the paper's four-layered architecture (Legal, Governance, Operational, Economic) into an actionable roadmap.

The plan is divided into three main phases, each with specific objectives, detailed tasks, and clear milestones.

**Our Mission:** To build a transparent, equitable, and community-driven ecosystem for fostering innovation, addressing the shortcomings of traditional startup accelerators.

## Phase 1: Foundational Setup (Months 0-6)

**Objective:** To establish the legal, technical, and governance backbone of the DAO, and to cultivate the initial community required for launch.

### 1.1. Legal & Administrative
*   **Task 1: Establish Digital Identity.**
    *   **Action:** Register the `darvishvand.ventures` domain name.
    *   **Action:** Register the primary email address (e.g., `contact@darvishvand.ventures`).
    *   **Action:** Secure key social media handles (e.g., Twitter, Discord, GitHub).
    *   **Details:** Securing our brand and communication channels is the first step before any public announcement.
    *   **Estimated Cost:** ~$15.
*   **Task 2: Incorporate as a DAO LLC.**
    *   **Action:** File for a DAO LLC in Wyoming, leveraging its favorable legal framework for decentralized organizations.
    *   **Details:** This provides a crucial legal wrapper, limiting liability for members and allowing the DAO to interact with off-chain entities.
    *   **Estimated Cost:** ~$50-200.
*   **Task 3: Draft Initial Legal & Governance Documents.**
    *   **Action:** Create the initial versions of the DAO's Charter, Operating Agreement, and a clear Privacy Policy.
    *   **Details:** These documents will be ratified by the founding members. They will outline the core rules, member responsibilities, and data privacy commitments.

### 1.2. Technical Infrastructure
*   **Task 1: Deploy Core DAO Contracts.**
    *   **Platform:** Ethereum Layer 2 (Arbitrum) for low transaction costs.
    *   **Action:** Deploy the core governance framework using audited, open-source solutions like Aragon.
    *   **Action:** Establish the DAO Treasury using a Gnosis Safe multi-signature wallet for secure asset management.
*   **Task 2: Launch Public-Facing Interfaces.**
    *   **Action:** Develop and deploy a simple, professional website on `darvishvand.ventures`.
    *   **Content:** The site must include a clear manifesto, an overview of the DAO's mission, links to community channels, and a portal for viewing proposals (e.g., integrating with Tally.xyz or Snapshot).
*   **Task 3: Establish Community & Communication Channels.**
    *   **Action:** Set up and configure a Discord server as the primary hub for community interaction.
    *   **Action:** Create a Twitter account for announcements and broader outreach.

### 1.3. Governance Framework - Initial Setup
*   **Task 1: Define and Ratify Initial Governance Parameters.**
    *   **Action:** Formally propose and vote on the initial set of governance rules.
    *   **Illustrative Starting Parameters:**
        *   **Proposal Threshold:** 0.1% of total token supply required to submit a proposal.
        *   **Voting Period:** 5 days.
        *   **Quorum Requirement:** 10% of the circulating supply must participate for a vote to be valid.
*   **Task 2: Structure the Proposal Lifecycle.**
    *   **Action:** Document and implement the five-phase proposal process: Ideation, Drafting, Review, Voting, Execution.
    *   **Details:** This ensures proposals are well-vetted and aligned with the DAO's objectives before consuming resources.
*   **Task 3: Draft the Reputation Score System.**
    *   **Action:** Develop the initial formula for the non-transferable reputation score based on Tenure, Proposal Success, Contribution Value, and Voting Participation.
    *   **Details:** This will be a core mechanism for rewarding meaningful contribution over pure capital. The final formula will be determined by the community.

### 1.4. Financials
*   **Task 1: Seed the Treasury.**
    *   **Action:** Make the initial treasury deposit.
    *   **Amount:** $100, as specified in the research for the ultra-lean bootstrapping phase.
*   **Task 2: Establish Treasury Management Policy.**
    *   **Action:** Formally adopt the Core-Satellite model for treasury management.
    *   **Allocation:** 60-70% in stablecoins (Core) and 30-40% in higher-growth assets (Satellite), subject to DAO approval.

>> COMMENT:

### **Milestone for Phase 1:**
*   **Successful launch of the first venture proposal and the formation of the first "Venture Pod."**

## Phase 2: Venture Incubation & Community Growth (Months 6-24)

**Objective:** To prove the model by successfully incubating the first ventures, growing the community, and beginning the process of progressive decentralization.

### 2.1. Operations & Execution
*   **Task 1: Launch and Support 1-3 Ventures.**
    *   **Action:** Guide the first Venture Pods through their execution phase, providing operational support and mentorship.
*   **Task 2: Establish the Community Pod.**
    *   **Action:** Form a dedicated "Community Pod" responsible for DAO health, member onboarding, and security.
    *   **Responsibilities:** This pod will manage the bug bounty program, review platform updates, and monitor for governance risks.
*   **Task 3: Begin Performance Tracking.**
    *   **Action:** Implement the data collection and analysis framework outlined in the research.
    *   **Metrics:** Track and report monthly on:
        *   **Governance Quality Index (GQI)**
        *   **Cost-per-Active-Participant-Month (CAPM)**
        *   **Composite Engagement Index (CEI)**
