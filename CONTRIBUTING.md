# Contributing to Darvishvand.Ventures

We love receiving contributions from the community and are thrilled that you're interested in helping us improve the project.

## How to Contribute

There are many ways to contribute, from writing tutorials or blog posts, improving the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests, or writing code that can be incorporated into the project itself.

### Reporting Bugs

If you find a bug, please open an issue on our GitHub repository. When you report a bug, please include the following:

- A clear and descriptive title.
- A detailed description of the problem, including steps to reproduce it.
- The expected behavior and what actually happened.
- Your environment details (e.g., OS, browser, Node.js version).

### Suggesting Enhancements

If you have an idea for a new feature or an improvement to an existing one, please open an issue on our GitHub repository. This allows us to discuss the idea and determine the best way to implement it.

### Pull Requests

If you'd like to contribute code, please follow these steps:

1.  Fork the repository.
2.  Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix: `git checkout -b my-new-feature`
3.  Make your changes and commit them with a descriptive message.
4.  Push your changes to your fork: `git push origin my-new-feature`
5.  Open a pull request to the `main` branch of our repository.

## Style Guides

### Git Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature").
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...").
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less.
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line.

### Code Style

- Follow the coding style guide for the language you are using (e.g., PEP 8 for Python, Airbnb style for JavaScript).
- Make sure your code is well-documented.
